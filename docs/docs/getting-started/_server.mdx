## Deploy server

You will learn a bit later how to [configure Meemaw](/docs/server#config) and modify the [Docker compose configuration](/docs/server#docker-compose) for your specific needs, but if you downloaded the example above, **there is just one thing you need to do**: in `server/.env`, update `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_API_KEY` with yours.

Then you can actually deploy the server. **Make sure you're in the server directory and that Docker is running**, then just start the server with:

```
docker compose up
```

You should be greeted with a bunch of text, including something like this:
```
meemaw_app  | 2042/05/04 11:59:59 Logging enabled
meemaw_app  | 2042/05/04 11:59:59 Connected to DB
meemaw_app  | 2042/05/04 11:59:59 Schema does not exist, creating...
meemaw_app  | 2042/05/04 11:59:59 Schema loaded
meemaw_app  | 2042/05/04 11:59:59 Starting server on port 8421
```

Congrats, Meemaw's server is running ðŸŽ‰
