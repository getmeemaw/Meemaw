## Meemaw Cloud

The first step is to [create an account](https://getmeemaw.com/cloud/signup) with Meemaw cloud. Don't forget to confirm your sign up by using the link in the email you will receive.

Once this is done, you can [log into Meemaw Cloud](https://getmeemaw.com/cloud/signup) so that we can configure a few elements:

### Configure your Auth

Inside your dashboard, click "Auth" from the left menu. From there, you can configure how your users are authenticated and authentified.

For the sake of this example, **select "Supabase" as Auth provider, then provide your Supabase URL and Supabase API Key**. Don't forget to save.

### Provide your website URL

Now if you click "Security" from the left menu, you can provide your website URL so that Meemaw Cloud can start accepting requests coming from it.

### Find your project URL

Finally, just click "API" from the left menu. From there, you will be able to copy your project URL. This will be useful when initialising Meemaw SDKs inside your clients!

It looks something like this:
