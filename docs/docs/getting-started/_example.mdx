## Run the example

Let's run the example a first time, then we'll go through part of the code together to understand how the Meemaw part works.

### Configure your App
Before we do anything, there are just three things you need to configure on the client side: 
- Your project URL. Find `Meemaw.init()` in the file `client/src/app/tx.jsx` and update it with your project URL: 
    ```javascript title="client/src/app/tx.jsx"
    const meemaw = await Meemaw.init('https://getmeemaw.co/YOUR-PROJECT-URL');
    ```
    - Note: if you're self-hosting Meemaw locally, you just need to uncomment the localhost line.
- The URL of your JSON-RPC API. Update the following line with your own URL:
    ```javascript title="client/src/app/tx.jsx"
    const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider("YOUR-JSON-RPC-API-URL"));
    ```
- Your Supabase URL and API Key. Modify `.env.local` in the `client/` folder, replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and `YOUR_SUPABASE_API_KEY` with yours. Those are the same you provided in your Meemaw Cloud dashboard. This is only required because the example showcases a full signup/login process.

### Install dependencies
Cool so you've got the source code downloaded on your machine and the project is configured and ready to be launched. Just before we can run our example, we need to install all dependencies. **Open a new terminal and make sure you're in the client directory** then run this command:

```
npm install
```

### Start the app

Now is finally show time:

```
npm run dev
```

Boom ! üéâ

You should now see something like this in your terminal, amongst other things :

```
Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

Just visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should see our app ü•≥

### Send your first transaction
When you open the example for the first time as a "fresh" user, **you will have to sign up on Supabase**. Simply click on "I don't have an account yet", and sign up using your email and password. Note that an email will be sent to confirm your registration. Once you've confirmed the registration, you should be logged in our example app. If this is not the case, simply log in.

The next step is to **create a wallet** for this user. Just click on "Generate Wallet", and everything will happen magically behind the scenes. A wallet will be generated in concert between the client and the server through the MPC-TSS process. Note that there is an obvious potential improvement here: you could automatically create a wallet at sign up!

Once the wallet is created, we have one last step we need to take before being able to send a transaction: **add some funds to our wallet**. Otherwise, obviously, there will be nothing to send... One way to get some funds on the Sepolia network is to use a faucet like this one: https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/ Just enter the ETH address of your new wallet and "start mining". It will take some time, make sure you let it run until you have the minimum required amount, but not more (we don't need much).

Excellent, now is finally time to **send our first transaction!** Wait the few seconds necessary for funds to arrive in your new wallet, then send the transaction to whatever wallet you wish to make slightly richer üòÅ Again, everything will happen magically behind the scenes in concert between the client and the server. The transaction will be signed through the MPC-TSS process then broadcast on the blockchain.

Congratulations, you've made your first transaction using Meemaw üéâ

## Understand how it works
We will check what happens when you click on the button to send an ETH transaction.

The first step is to get a wallet for the given user. If it's the first time the user tries to do anything that requires a wallet, the Meemaw SDK will automatically [create a new wallet](/docs/how-does-it-work) for that user. Otherwise, it will just [recover the wallet](/docs/how-does-it-work) from storage. It's as easy as instantiating Meemaw with the server URL then calling `GetWallet` with the Supabase JWT :

```javascript title="client/src/app/tx.jsx"
// Create or recover a wallet for this user
const meemaw = new Meemaw('meemaw-url');
const wallet = await meemaw.GetWallet(jwt); // will recover the wallet if exists for the user or create a new one
```

Once we've got a wallet, we can create an ETH transaction. We do that with the web3.js library. Note that we also use `wallet.From()` to easily get the user's wallet address.

```javascript title="client/src/app/tx.jsx"
// Instantiate Web3
const web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('rpc-url'));

// Get important information for the transaction
const nonce = await web3.eth.getTransactionCount(wallet.From())
const gasPrice = await web3.eth.getGasPrice();
const chainId = 11155111; // We use the Sepolia test net to easily test the whole process
// const chainId = await web3.eth.getChainId();

// Craft the transaction (adapt to  your needs)   
const raw = {
    'to': '0x809ccc37d2dd55a8e8fa58fc51d101c6b22425a8',
    'value': 10000000000000, 
    'nonce': Number(nonce),
    'gasLimit': 21000,
    'gasPrice': Number(gasPrice),
};
```

Last thing is to sign and send the transaction. It's as easy as using `wallet.SignTransaction()` then sending the transaction with web3.js. Note that we need to provide the `chainId` to sign the transaction in order to avoid replay attacks on other chains :

```javascript title="client/src/app/tx.jsx"
// Sign the transaction
const signedTransaction = await wallet.SignTransaction(raw, chainId);

// Send the signed transaction
const txReceipt = await web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTransaction);
```

That's it!
