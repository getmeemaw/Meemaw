## Requirements

You need:

{props.name === 'cloud' ? (<CloudRequirements />) : (<SelfRequirements />)}

Also, let's download a working example so that we can get our feet wet super easily:

```
git clone https://github.com/getmeemaw/example-js.git
```

Once the example is downloaded, you can already `cd example-js` to be ready for the next steps.

We will explain the Meemaw specific parts of this example in this page. The rest is typical React and some [Supabase specific stuff](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/auth-ui).

{props.name === 'cloud' ? <Cloud /> : <Server />}
<Example />


## Next steps

Okay, we've got a nice example running. However, this is clearly not a production setup. Here is a non-exhaustive list of a few elements that you would need to change to get your App ready for production:

{props.name === 'cloud' ? (<CloudNextSteps />) : (<SelfNextSteps />)}

We will soon offer a Cloud service to make it super easy for you to have a production-ready setup in a few minutes.
