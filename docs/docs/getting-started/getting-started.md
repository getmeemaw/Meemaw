# Getting Started

So you want to start using Meemaw?! Excellent! ðŸ¤˜

You have two ways to start using Meemaw:
- **[Cloud](/docs/getting-started/cloud)** (recommended): we manage everything for you, you just have to integrate Meemaw SDKs in your client code
- **[Self-hosted](/docs/getting-started/self-host)**: you deploy Meemaw on your servers and databases
