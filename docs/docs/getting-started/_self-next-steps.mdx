* **Fix Meemaw's version:** in the Docker Compose file, replace the "latest" tag with the actual version you want to use. This avoids breaking changes affecting your setup.
* **Separate Meemaw's DB from the server:** we cheated a bit here by magically deploying a Postgresql DB with Docker Compose. You probably want to have a proper managed DB with adequate accesses.
* **Separate Meemaw from the App server:** your App is served from the same machine as Meemaw. You should separate them and greatly reduce access to the Meemaw machine. Keep it secure.
* **Buid the App and serve static files:** you should not run `npm run dev` in production. Instead, you should build the App and serve the files through a proper web server.
* **Follow security guidelines:** your Meemaw installation is only as secure as the security measures you follow. Please make sure you follow all [our security guidelines](/docs/security)
